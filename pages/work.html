    <p>Each project listed below has allowed me to explore and learn more about different aspects about web development.
      And with each new project I have used what I have learned previously in order to create more complex websites each time.</p>

      <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>This is my most recent project, the website this summary is displayed on. Here I have begun to incorporate Javascript design elements
        into the project, allowing for animations and displaying my resume. I have also divereted away from using bootstrap (aside from the navbar)
        when displaying my page. This was intentional, as my goal was to be more comfortable creating my own, reusable, code that is both aesthetically
        pleasing, properly placed, and responsive. Additionally, I have used this site to become more comfortable with editing bootstraps code to fit my
        own projects better, as seen in the unique design of the bootstrap navbar. All of this combined has created a website I am proud
        to utilize in showcasing myself, my work, and my travels. </p>

      <h2>Petra Commercial Building - Oakland</h2>
      <p>This website was made for a client and was my second freelancing job. Although a 1-page landing site was all that was requested, I took this opportunity
        to expand my knowledge with bootstrap, utilizing the grid to its fullest extent for what was needed to create this website. Additionally, one of the best
        concepts I was able to learn was to be able to utilize an API and display non-static information on the page - in the form of Google Maps API. Aside from the challenges
        of learning how to effectively use an API, responsiveness was the most challenging aspect of this project. I needed to use multiple <em>Media Queries</em> to
        ensure the website displayed properly on multiple device sizes. Another important learning aspect of this project was being able to experience communication with
        a client - someone who needed something done other than me. At this point I was comfortable with taking an approach the client wanted, and also had the confidence to
        approach requests I had not implemented yet. </p>

      <h2>Bookkeeping Website</h2>
      <p>This was my first freelancing job, made for my father's side business. This was an opportunity to learn how to implement features requested by someone else.
        Although my limitations were greater at the time, I was able to commuincate at a more personal level with my father and used the lax deadline date to implement features
        I had learned as I was creating the website. I used the Bootstrap grid to ensure responsiveness and cleanliness throughout the one page website. Additionally, using other
        Bootstrap components such as the <em>Carousel</em> and <em>Cards</em> to display information in a more effective manner.  </p>
