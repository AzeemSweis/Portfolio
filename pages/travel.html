          <p>I took this trip with my girlfriend on November 13, 2020. We drove from
            Reno, NV to Santa Cruz, CA. We took I-80 West for the majority of the trip,
            going through Sacramento and the East Bay Towns. Being so close to the water,
            but viewing it from the cliffs was a unique sight for us. And the rainy weather
            that day only served to enance the experience.</p>
          <img src="../images/SantaCruz/SantaCruz2020_2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid gal-img">
          <p>Driving back, through San Francisco, we got word that Donner Pass, our route home,
            was snowing heavily and that we required chains. After some quick thinking on our feet,
            we managed to secure some new chains for the car and we made our way up the mountain.
            Although we were able to get the chains on the car successfully (and keep them throughout the drive),
            I highly recommending practicing chain installations at home rather than on a mountain in the freezing cold.</p>

          <p>After getting lunch at the Santa Cruz Pier, we drove up the California 1 highway,
            a first for the both of us in this part of the state, all the way to Pacifica,
            where I practically forced us to stop by <em>Taco Bell By The Sea</em>. Driving up the 1 was amazing,
            the highway coming so close to the water. After stopping
            where I wanted to stop, we drove up to Daly City and went where she wanted to go, a super target
            with 2 stories and an escalator, which in and of itself is an experience. </p>

    <p class="subhead">This was a camping trip my father and I took together in June. Located in Southern Utah,
      The Grand Staircase Escalante is a marvelous place, unlike any other I've seen. And I've
      been looking forward to going back since I left.</p>

            <p>Starting in Las Vegas, Nevada, my father and I drove up the I-15. A 6-hour drive ahead of us,
              we were excited to figure out and make use of the Jeep Wrangler we rented. Our destination was
              <em>Lower Calf Creek Falls</em>, a campsite located next to - what we were going to find out -
              is located next to one of the most beautiful trails in the National Park. </p>
            <img src="../images/GrandStairs/GSE2.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid gal-img">
            <p>After setting up our campsite and having lunch we prepared for our first hike, which was located right next the camp. <em>Calf Creek Falls</em> is a
              6 mile hike with a rewarding waterfall at the end. Although I had hiked often before, I had never been on a hike quite like this. With the elevation changes as well as
              being directly next to the river that the waterfall fed, we got to expereince various scenery. Ranging from marshy and green near the river, to red and dry at higher elevations. Arriving at the waterfall, my father and
              I were greeted with one of the most spectacular sights I've ever seen. The ice cold water felt amazing on our feet and knees after a rigrous hike, and lunch with that scenic view was amazing.</p>

            <p>After 5 hours we began our journey into the park. Before we even reached our campsite we were already in awe
              at what we were seeing. Huge swaths of land as far as the eye could see, different eco-systetms ranging from mountains,
              to lush green valleys, to desert were all next to each other before we began our descent into the park. Underestimating how busy our
              campsite was going to be, we were able to secure a spot due to sheer luck of catching a group leaving as soon as we arrived. </p>
            <img src="../images/GrandStairs/GSE4.png" alt="" class="img-fluid gal-img">
            <p>The hike back was just as beautiful althought we were retracing our steps. Reaching the end, we got ourselves cleaned up, and started to prepare dinner.
              It was getting dark out and seeing the stars were marvelous. We didn't bring sleeping bags with us, but fortunately it was mid-summer and we had loads of blankets just in case.
              In the morning we prepared a breakfast of bacon, potatos and eggs and prepared for the various hikes we were going to do around the park.</p>

            <p>Peek-a-boo gultch was marvelous, between the magnificent rock formations and the tight places to squeeze between, it was a hiking experience like no other.
            After about 30 mintues of "crawling" throught the gultch and taking as many pictures as we could, we found an open area where we could rest and eat. Another father and son hiking duo came across our little picking and after an friendly exchange of words, they went on their way. After we finished our food, we began to hike again and we quickly came to the end
            of the first gultch. Unfortunately we became disoriented and had to turn back. After making it back to the beginning of the valley and to the ascent, we realized we had underestimated the difficulty of the climb up and spent
            most of our energy making it back to the top. After hydrating and resting at the top of the climb, we made the 2-mile hike back to the car. </p>

            <p>From the 3 hikes we did our second day at the park. This one was my absolute favorite. The Spooky Canyon Loop began with an almost 2 mile hike to what would be a long, steep descent into the Canyon.
              This hike is certainly not intended for the impatient. With the sun bearing down it is important to stay hydrated. After the descent there were two gultches that could be tackled, one following the other, before
              leading back to the beginning - where the ascent to the first 2-mile leg was. We chose to do "Peek-a-boo" gultch first and the formations I saw were unlike anything I had seen before in my life.
              The picture to the left shows my dad walking to the gultches after the descent. After balancing our way down the steep mountainside, we were eager to be on flat ground again. The massive wall to the left of him leads us to the open
              valleys where
              the gultches are located. </p>

            Easily my favorite leg of the trip, the elevation climb led to some of the most beautiful forest scenes and sights I had seen in a long time.
            Although unpaved, there were a good amount of people also checking out the route - although not too many to hinder the experience in anyway - and for the most part
